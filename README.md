## Heya, I'm Patrick Maguire 👋

I build stuff and solve problems, these days by writing & architecting software and building strong teams and interpersonal relationships.

#### ⛏️ Key Skills

- Creating full stack apps using Python and Javascript, potentially with SvelteKit and/or Flask
- Working with a wide range of stakeholders to make sure I'm not just building something but the *right* thing.
- Deploying said apps on AWS (I built and owned all the software cloud infrastructure at the last place I worked)

#### 🌎 My Background
 
- https://maguire.engineering ([Source](https://github.com/pmaguire/maguire.engineering)) has a quick rundown of my professional life (and a taste of my design and coding abilities).

#### 💬 Ask me about

- Learning enough C# and .NET just to build one tiny microservice for a library that wasn't available in any language I knew 😑 (And why it was the right decision)
- How to make Scrum and Agile work better for you (I've been a scrum master several times and designed/implemented multiple software development processes)
- My time in [Doctors Without Borders](https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/) ⛑️
- Writing CLI tools in PHP (Did they work? Sure did. Would I ever go back to it after learning Python? No.)
